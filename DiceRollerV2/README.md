This application is an updated version of the orginal dice roller application that includes new features such as:
- A name and description section that can be assign to each die.
- A save button to display the name and description of the die
- A section that displays the die and corresponding number that the die rolled

I am currently still working on this version to be mobile device capable and be able to have a save function for various 
types of games like Dungeons and dragons (DND) and Warhammer 40k

Please enjoy the application and feel free to comment on any improvemnts or ideas that should be added to the application
